This repository contains code and data to facilitate a collaboration between Vogelwarte and Richard Holland (Bangor University). The purpose of the code and data is to prepare GPS tracking data for the extraction of magnetic field variables (inclination, declination, intensity) that can then be compared between the first autumn migration of soaring migratory birds (red kite and Egyptian vulture) and their first return journey.

Example data for 10 juveniles from two unrelated projects are provided to test these ideas.
